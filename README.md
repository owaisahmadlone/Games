## 1: Prisoner's Dilemna:
This is an insanely popular game in game theory. I have simulated the game in python using 4 players: 1. joss(starts with cooperating and responds with opponents previous moves) 2. freidmann ( cooperates until the opponent defects first and then always defects) 3. angel (always cooperates) 4. demon ( always defects)
